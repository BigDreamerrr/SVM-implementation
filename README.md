# SVM model using Quadratic solver which solves 4 conditions group of KKT

Tested on small datasets like Iris(binary prediction on each three species) and titanic, achieving decent scores. On Titanic, I achieve 0.76555. On each class of species, I achieve respectively 1.0 on 'Iris-setosa', 
0.94 on 'Iris-versicolor' and 0.94 on 'Iris-virginica'
